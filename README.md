Blogger Web Application - Local Level Design Document
1. Introduction
The Blogger web application is designed to provide a platform for users to create, publish, and manage blog posts. This document outlines the internal architecture and components of the Blogger application.

# 2. System Architecture
## 2.1 Frontend Components
* HTML Templates: Define the structure and layout of web pages.
* CSS Stylesheets: Apply styles to HTML elements for visual presentation.
* JavaScript: Handle client-side interactions and dynamic content.
# 2.2 Backend Components
Flask Application: Core application logic implemented using the Flask web framework.
Database: Store data related to blog posts, users, comments, etc.
ORM (Object-Relational Mapping): Interact with the database in an object-oriented manner (using SQLAlchemy).
Authentication System: Handle user authentication and authorization.
Blog Management: CRUD operations for managing blog posts.
Comment System: Allow users to comment on blog posts.
* 2.3 Interaction Between Components
Frontend-Backend Communication: HTTP requests and responses exchanged between frontend and backend.
Routing: Flask routes incoming requests to appropriate handlers.
Database Interaction: Read and write data to/from the database.
Authentication Middleware: Ensure authentication and authorization for protected routes.
Template Rendering: Render HTML templates with dynamic data.
* 2.4 Security Considerations
Protect against common web vulnerabilities (XSS, CSRF, SQL Injection).
Use secure password hashing algorithms (bcrypt) for user authentication.
Implement access controls to restrict user actions.
# 3. Component Details
* 3.1 Flask Application
Routes: Define routes for handling different URL endpoints.
Request Handlers: Functions to process incoming requests and generate responses.
Middleware: Add middleware for authentication, error handling, etc.
* 3.2 Database Schema
Tables: Define tables for storing users, blog posts, comments, etc.
Relations: Define relationships between tables (e.g., user-blog post relationship).
Indexes: Add indexes for efficient data retrieval.
* 3.3 Authentication System
User Registration: Allow users to create new accounts.
Login/Logout: Authenticate users and manage user sessions.
Password Reset: Provide functionality for resetting forgotten passwords.
* 3.4 Blog Management
Create Post: Allow users to create new blog posts.
Edit Post: Enable users to edit their existing blog posts.
Delete Post: Allow users to delete their blog posts.
3.5 Comment System
Add Comment: Allow users to add comments to blog posts.
View Comments: Display comments associated with each blog post.
Moderation: Implement moderation features for managing comments.
# 4. Deployment Considerations
Hosting: Choose a suitable hosting platform (e.g., Heroku, AWS, DigitalOcean).
Database: Select a database solution (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite).
Scaling: Design for scalability to handle increased traffic and data volume.
Monitoring: Implement monitoring and logging for system health and performance.
# 5. Conclusion
The Local Level Design document provides a detailed overview of the internal architecture and components of the Blogger web application. It serves as a blueprint for development, deployment, and maintenance of the application.
